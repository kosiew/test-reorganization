# Happychat Floating Note üëª

A userscript for [Happychat](https://github.com/Automattic/happychat) HUD that creates persistent floating notes.

- Helps avoid sending private notes to a user.
- Can still use `/note` normally as you please.
- Manage long-running notes without the need for a separate text app window.
- Note data is automatically saved as you switch between chats.

## Installation

1. Add `happychat-floating-note.js` contents to a userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/). The CSS styles are embedded within the script itself.
2. There are some easily customizable `options` in the script such as the floating note background color and a note template string.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Take care to backup your custom options & other changes anytime you are updating to a newer script version.
